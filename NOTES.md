## Challenges
- The required endpoint does not allow me to make CORS requests in the browser.
- Curl and Insomnia requests work as expected.
- Preflight requests were triggered with just the presense of additional headers.
- To circumvent the CORS issue, a browser extension was used called "[Moesif Origin & CORS Changer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc)"

## Needed Improvements
- Readability
- More thorough unit tests and possibly some integration tests
- Employ a state management lib like redux or mobx
- More color and interactivity
- Better organization of css and or use of dynamic (React) styling patterns
- Refactor components into their own files
